# Terminal Calculator

Input the number of numbers you want to calculate an then type the numbers and the operation signs with space between them.
As operation signs, you get to choose between multiplication, divide, hashtag (this will gather the 2 numbers and the result will be multiplicated with himself), gathering and difference. 
The program respects the order of operations and the hashtag, as a priority to calculate, is between the multiplication/divide and gathering/difference.
This program was created using 2 linked lists, one for numbers and other for the operation signs. 
The algorithm calculates until one element from the numbers list remains, which also will be the final result
